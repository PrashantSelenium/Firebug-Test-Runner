== Firebug Test Runner ==

This module intends to automate the process of running the Firebug tests (https://getfirebug.com/tests/)
which can be downloaded and installed here: http://getfirebug.com/releases/fbtest/

The module examines data stored by the Firebug team in a file on their servers to determine which versions
of the Firebug tests to run against which versions of Firefox.  The module then downloads the latest
tinderbox builds of those Firefox versions, runs the tests and sends the results to the specified
database.

There is a configuration file in the %PKG_DIR%/fb_runner/config directory so you don't have to set the
command line parameters manually each time.


Current results of three VM's running this module are posted here:
